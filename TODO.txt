*** CityGML Energy ADE TODO list ***

    * >> Add 'constructionOrientation' name to association between '<<ADEElement>> _CityObject' and 'ConstructionOrientation'

        I'm not able to create a construction or constructionOrientation underneath a roof surface (I suppose it doesn't work for any BoundarySurface). Please check if it works for buildings and buildings parts, too.

        --> Can be fixed by adding a role to relations? If yes, to which relations?

    * >> - Set a bidirectionnal association between 'EnergyConversionSystem' and 'energy:_AbstractBuilding'

        Doesn't work for me. I can create EnergyConversionSystems underneath <cityobjectmember>, but not underneath a building. Is there still one of the two role labels missing in the diagram?

        --> Fixed by adding a 'has' role

    * 1) I don't know if you solved it, but I'm still unable to create references via xlinks.

    * 2) I cannot create ThermalBoundarySurfaces underneath ThermalZones. The "boundedBy" role is missing in ThermalZoneType.

        --> Seems the role is not generated while converting from EAP to XSD. Do not understand why as other roles seems to be well generated.
            Can be fixed by manually adding the role (not an ideal solution ...)
            <element name="boundedBy" type="energy:ThermalBoundarySurfacePropertyType" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> ?

    * 3) The target namespace of the XSD is at "http://www.sig3d.org/citygml/2.0/energy/1.0" and version is at version="0.3".

        --> Fixed. Current version is 0.4.3

    * The featureType Glazing (which may have several glazes and gas gapes) is actually not a "Material" but a "LayerComponent". Then, it should not inherit from AbstractMaterial but from LayerComponent. Following that, the "OpaqueMaterial" object should be renamed as "SolidMaterial" (with the same parameters, at less for the first release).

        --> Fixed. Note that it also require to change 'LayerComponent' stereotype from 'dataType' to 'featureType'.
